# Jump Vaders - A Fabric Server-Side Mod

## What is it
its a mod that lets you place "Jump Vaders" similar to quark's elevators from forge.
You simply place one above the other at any vertical distance, and jump/crouch on top of the
block to go inbetween the different heights.

## Crafting
you can craft these with glass on the top and bottom rows of
the crafting table, with a row of ender pearls in-between.

## Inspirations/Credit
A large amount of inspiration for this and the sister mod, Vanillify,
goes to [ExtraCraftTX](https://github.com/ExtraCrafTX/)
